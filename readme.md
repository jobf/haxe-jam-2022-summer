# Theme Ideas

Theme is 
> Lose it all

## Empty Vessel

Run around a level constantly losing fluid.

When you get to the end of the level you should have lost it all.

If you stop you die.

If you run out of fluid before reaching the end zone you die.

Make a few levels of increasing difficulty.

## Hide and collect

The level has enemies to evade and items to collect.

When you hide in a shadow for long enough an enemy has lost you.

Collect all items in a level, in order to finish.

Collecting levels means you must risk being seen.

You cannot exit a level unless all you lost all the enemies.

## Worst Sport Manager

You manage a sports team.

Before each match you purchase players.

The idea is to lose every match.

So you have to build the team from the worst.

But another team can always be even worse than you.

## Pigeons

You visit a friend who keeps homing pigeons.

Every day they are training the pigeons, by visiting them all in their shed and giving them a map to return home.

Your agenda is to visit all the pigeons and convince them not to come back, instead they need to get lost.

You just want the pigeons to be free. Lost them all.

So visit each pigeon and alter tha map so it is incorrect.

Each level the friend brings more pigeons so the challenge is to convince enough to get lost before he replenishes stock.

## Getaway Driver

Driving away trying to lose the other vehicles chasing you.

Get to the end of the level and don't get caught.

You have to jump over holes while the chasers fall down them. Or e.g. obstacles they will collide into.

Each level the chasers get faster, more of them, longer level.
